<p class="PageTitle">What is SMART?</p>
<p class="BodyText">SMART, officially written as S.M.A.R.T., stands for Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology. SMART is a monitoring system for computer   hard disks and SSDs to detect and report on various indicators of reliability, in the   hope of anticipating failures.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Disk failures fall into one of two basic categories, predictable   failures and unpredictable failures. We are interested in the former; in the   latter case, the disk fails catastrophically and without warning. In the case of   predictable failures, disks usually begin to exhibit signs and symptoms   that--since hard drives are mechanical devices--can be detected and tracked over   time. These trends provide an early warning system that a hard disk is getting   ready to die. Solid State Disks are not mechanical, and so they have no mechanical components that can break. However, they too can exhibit problems that can be detected and reported. As SSDs evolve, the SMART standards for them will likely evolve as well. Thus, reporting for SSDs may not be quite as reliable as it is for HDDs, mainly because hard disks have not fundamentally changed in many years, whereas SSDs are still a fledgling technology.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Mechanical failures account for about 60 percent of all drive failures. Most   mechanical failures result from gradual wear, although an eventual failure may   be catastrophic. However, before complete failure occurs, there are usually   certain indications that failure is imminent. These may include increased heat   output, increased noise level, problems with reading and writing of data, an   increase in the number of damaged disk sectors, and so on.</p>
<p class="BodyText">The purpose of SMART is to warn a user or a system administrator of   impending drive failure while there is still time to take preventive action,   such as copying the data to a replacement device. Approximately 64% of failures   can be predicted by SMART. Work at Google on over 100,000 drives has shown   little overall predictive value of SMART status as a whole, but suggests   that certain sub-categories of information which some SMART implementations   track do correlate with actual failure rates â€“ specifically, in the 60 days   following the first scan error on a drive, the drive is, on average, 39 times   more likely to fail than it would have been had no such error occurred. Also,   first errors in reallocations, offline reallocations and probational counts are   strongly correlated to higher probabilities of failure.

<p class="BodyText">WindowSMART 2015 monitors the ATA SMART attribute set, which is   supported on many IDE (PATA) and SATA hard disks (HDDs) and SSDs. WindowSMART does not   read SCSI SMART attributes but can, however, read SMART data from many HDDs and SSDs connected via USB or IEEE 1394 (FireWire). WindowSMART can also report limited failure   information about most disks, regardless of type. This information is simply a   true/false failure prediction flag reported by the Microsoft Windows storage   driver WMI class.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Note that depending on how a SATA controller is configured in the BIOS, it may be reported as being a &quot;SCSI&quot; device--this is sometimes the case when a SATA controller is configured in AHCI mode instead of IDE mode. WindowSMART can usually still read SMART dta from them. It is &quot;true&quot; SCSI devices, which were very common in the 1990s and early 2000s, that WindowSMART does not support. Disks attached to Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) <em>may </em>be readable by WindowSMART.</p>
<p class="BodyText">The ATA SMART specification defines a set of attributes. Each attribute   tracks a particular characteristic of a hard disk (i.e. bad sectors, spin-up   time, temperature). Disk manufacturers are free to implement as many or as few   attributes as they choose; a manufacturer can claim a hard disk is SMART   capable even if only one attribute is implemented. Most disks have 10-20   attributes defined; disks may have up to 30 different attributes. Visit the   aforementioned Wikipedia article about SMART for details on the most common   ones. (The Wikipedia article features only HDD attributes. SSD attributes vary widely by SSD controller manufacturer and are not featured in the Wiki.)</p>
<p class="BodyText">Each attribute contains the following fields:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><span class="UnorderedListHeader"><strong>Attribute ID</strong> - </span><span class="UnorderedListItem">SMART attributes possess an ID number   1-255 (01-FF in hex). </span></li>
  <li><span class="UnorderedListHeader"><strong>Flags</strong> - </span><span class="UnorderedListItem">Specifies whether or not an attribute is critical   or not; pre-fail or advisory; statistical, self-reporting or performance. </span></li>
  <li><span class="UnorderedListHeader"><strong>Raw Data</strong> - </span><span class="UnorderedListItem">This field is where the manufacturer stores   specific data relative to the attribute. While the manufacturer theoretically   could store any kind of data there, most often this field is used as a counter   of events, temperature (in Celsius), power-on hours (usually in seconds or   hours), etc. The raw data field can store data, in hexadecimal format, from   0x000000000000 - 0xFFFFFFFFFFFF. Oftentimes a vendor may use the lowest-order   bits (right-most) to store data such as counts, while using higher order bits to   store other data, possibly not even related to the attribute. That is why it's   possible to see a temperature given as &quot;00390FA0002F.&quot; This may seem extremely   high, but the temperature data is really only the last two bits, &quot;2F,&quot; which is   47 degrees Celsius, which isn't too high. </span></li>
  <li><span class="UnorderedListHeader"><strong>Value</strong> - </span><span class="UnorderedListItem">The value field is a vendor <em>normalized </em>field, which the vendor calculates from the raw value. This field is an   integer, and has a valid range of 0-253, inclusive. Higher values are typically   regarded as better. One may think that ideally this should be 253, but vendors   often select 100 or 200 as their (starting) &quot;normal&quot; value. Some values only   decrease, and never increase. Others can decrease and increase over the drive's   lifetime, and many change continuously throughout the course of a day. </span></li>
  <li><span class="UnorderedListHeader"><strong>Threshold</strong> - </span><span class="UnorderedListItem">This field is an integer, and can range from   1-253. This value never changes. The Threshold is the value you never want to   see the number in the Value field match or drop below; the Value should always   be higher than the Threshold. When the Value is greater than the Threshold, the   attribute is considered <em>healthy</em>. If the Value ever falls less than or   equal to the Threshold, the attribute is considered <em>failed</em>. When an   attribute <em>fails</em>, the SMART specification states that failure is   imminent (within 24 hours). This is not an exact figure. However, if you have an   attribute that has failed, you should consider backing up the data on the disk   and replacing it as soon as possible.
    </span>
    <ul type="circle">
      <li class="UnorderedListItem">The Threshold field can also be 0. If this is the case, the attribute is an <em>age-related </em>field, as opposed to a <em>health </em>field. Age-related   attributes can never fail. If the Value field ever falls to 0, it simply is an   indication the drive may be getting old and therefore could be nearing the end   of its life. WindowSMART regards a disk that possesses one or more   zero-threshold attributes with a Value of zero as <em>geriatric</em>.</li>
      <li class="UnorderedListItem">Because many SSDs ship from the factory with many attributes possessing a zero threshold and a zero value, they are never reported by WindowSMART as being <em>geriatric</em>. If they were, nearly every SSD would report as being geriatric the first time it is used.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><span class="UnorderedListHeader"><strong>Worst</strong> - </span><span class="UnorderedListItem">This is supposed to show the worst (lowest) value   ever recorded in the Value field. Many times this value is not preserved,   especially in non-critical and age-related attributes. </span></li>
  <li><span class="UnorderedListHeader"><strong>Status</strong> - </span><span class="UnorderedListItem">WindowSMART reports a status for every   attribute, based upon the values in the Raw Data, Value and Threshold fields.   The statuses are defined below: </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="BodyText">WindowSMART defines the following attribute status for every SMART   attribute except Temperature (C2 and E7):</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><span class="UnorderedListHeader"><strong>Healthy</strong> - </span><span class="UnorderedListItem">There are no problems detected with this   attribute. The Value is greater than the Threshold, and the Raw Data shows no   cause for alarm. A healthy attribute does not affect the drive's health status.   If all attributes are Healthy, the disk's health status is <em>Healthy</em>. </span></li>
  <li><span class="UnorderedListHeader"><strong>Degraded</strong> - </span><span class="UnorderedListItem">There are some problems detected that possess   the potential to become serious problems. Keep an eye on these. Values are still   greater than the Threshold, but the Raw Data is showing a reason to be   concerned. Attributes that can be Degraded are bad sectors, pending bad sectors,   reallocation events, end-to-end errors, uncorrectable sectors and CRC errors.   WindowSMART sets the health status of the drive to <em>Warning</em>. </span></li>
  <li><span class="UnorderedListHeader"><strong>Fail</strong> - </span><span class="UnorderedListItem">The SMART status of a drive, per the SMART   specification, is <em>fail </em>if <em>any </em>attribute's Value falls to less   than or equal to its Threshold. WindowSMART will indicate <strong>Fail</strong> for the attribute in question, and the drive's health   status will be set to <em>Critical</em>. </span></li>
  <li><span class="UnorderedListHeader"><strong>Geriatric</strong> - </span><span class="UnorderedListItem">An attribute has reached old age (geriatrics)   if its Value reaches zero, and the Threshold is also zero. If all other   attributes are Healthy or Geriatric, the disk's health status is <em>Geriatric</em>. </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="BodyText">WindowSMART defines the following statuses for Temperature only. The   temperatures displayed here are default values. If you want to use different   values, you can customize each temperature threshold individually. You also have   the option of not having WindowSMART warning you of the two lesser heat   conditions (warm and hot).</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><span class="UnorderedListHeader"><strong>Critical</strong> - </span><span class="UnorderedListItem">The disk temperature is &gt;= 65 Â°C / 149 Â°F.   This is dangerously hot and can quickly cause permanent damage to a disk. You   need to cool the disk off immediately. Check the computer (or external case)   fans to be sure they are functioning correctly and ensure there is good airflow.   The disk's health status will be set to <em>Critical</em>. </span></li>
  <li><span class="UnorderedListHeader"><strong>Overheated</strong> - </span><span class="UnorderedListItem">The disk temperature is &gt;= 55 Â°C / 131 Â°F.   This is very hot, and capable of causing permanent damage to a disk. You should   get the disk cooled quickly. The disk's health status will be set to <em>Warning</em>. </span></li>
  <li><span class="UnorderedListHeader"><strong>Hot</strong> - </span><span class="UnorderedListItem">The disk temperature is &gt;= 50 Â°C / 122 Â°F. This is   hot, and long-term operation at this temperature can shorten the disk's life   span. You should get the disk cooled off. The disk's health status is not changed, but an alert is raised<em></em>. </span></li>
  <li><span class="UnorderedListHeader"><strong>Caution</strong> - </span><span class="UnorderedListItem">The disk temperature is &gt;= 42 Â°C / 108 Â°F.   This is warm, but not serious. Keep a close eye on the disk, and if you see the   temperature creeping higher, you should check fans and airflow to improve the   temperature. This does not cause a change in the disk's health status.</span></li>
  <li><span class="UnorderedListHeader">Invalid - </span><span class="UnorderedListItem">The disk temperature reported has exceeded the <em>absurdity threshold</em> of 90 Â°C / 194 Â°F. Most disk drives, SSDs, CPUs and memory chips would be rendered inoperative, if not totally destroyed, at temperatures this high. Thus, any temperature reported higher than this will be flagged in the UI as being invalid, and no alerts will be raised.</span></li>
