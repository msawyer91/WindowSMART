<p class="PageTitle">Frequently Asked Questions</p>
<p class="BodyText">This page will attempt to answer some questions that commonly come up when   dealing with SMART and disk failures. It is not an all-inclusive list, and   if you can't find an answer here, hopefully you will be able to find the answer   elsewhere in this help file.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><strong>Q:</strong> One or more SMART attributes on my disk are showing   a status of <em>Fail</em>. How much time does the disk have before it   dies?<br />
  <strong>A:</strong> The SMART specification states that if an   attribute violates its threshold (the attribute value falls to less than or   equal to its threshold), the drive will fail within 24 hours. Unfortunately it's   not that simple. If you do have a disk that goes to a &quot;fail&quot; status like this,   you should heed the warning and take action quickly. Back up the data and follow   Windows Home Server procedures to remove the disk from the storage pool. Install   a replacement disk and integrate the replacement back into your pool. I have,   however, seen disks reporting &quot;imminent failure&quot; that survived for years; in   contrast, I've seen hard disks fail without any warning whatsoever.  If the disk   is still under warranty, you should definitely seek to replace it, as such   replacement should be free of charge (except perhaps return shipping).</p>
<p class="BodyText"><strong>Q:</strong> I chose to ignore a problem on a disk, and yet the problem still shows up in the UI. Why is this?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> When you ignore a problem, the service will stop raising an alert on that problem, provided the problem doesn't worsen. If this was the only problem on the disk, then the physical disk selector will show the disk as being healthy. However, the problem will still show up in the UI, in the SMART details, as well as the SMART Status dialogue. This is by design. Rather than completely burying and forgetting about the problem, it is kept just visible enough so that it is not forgotten.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><strong>Q:</strong> WindowSMART is reporting bad sectors, but CHKDSK   reports none. Why is this?<br />
  <strong>A:</strong> CHKDSK detects errors in the   logical file system, whereas disk sectors are physical components of the disk.   When the disk firmware detects a bad sector, that sector is remapped to the   spare area. In other words, the disk stops using the bad sector and instead   remaps attempts to use that sector to a good sector in the disk's reserved spare   area. This prevents the disk from &quot;losing&quot; capacity as bad sectors are reallocated, unless the pool of spare sectors is exhausted.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><strong>Q:</strong> The Windows event log reports an error with ID 7 and text   similar to &quot;The device, \Device\Harddisk1\D, has a bad block.&quot; However, WindowSMART is not reporting bad sectors for the disk in question. Why is   this?<br />
  <strong>A:</strong> A disk's firmware will only reallocate bad sectors   on <em>write </em>operations, not <em>read</em> operations. Disks may classify a   sector as a <em>pending </em>sector on a failed read, however. Windows' file   system driver may encounter failed read conditions that generate this error   message, or even write operations. Windows cannot, however, instruct the disk's   firmware to flag a sector as bad or pending. Only the disk's onboard firmware   can do that.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><strong>Q:</strong> Some of my disks show enormous raw values for Read Error   Rate and/or Write Error Rate, whereas others are zero.  WindowSMART does   not generate alerts on the non-zero ones.  Is anything   wrong?<br />
  <strong>A:</strong>  These are vendor-specific raw values. The field   is meant to store the rate of hardware related read and write errors, but the   raw value has a different structure for different vendors, and sometimes even   for the same vendor, and so the decimal number may or may not indicate a   problem. Unfortunately, I don't have access to each vendor's specific   documentation or APIs, and am thus unable to interpret the value.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><strong>Q:</strong> Is there an expected remaining lifetime for a disk that   develops a bad sector?<br />
  <strong>A:</strong> Google conducted research that   showed 64% of disks fail within 30 days of developing their first bad   sector.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><strong>Q:</strong> Are some attributes more critical than others? Why are   some attributes listed as <em>Critical</em>?<br />
  <strong>A:</strong> A <em>critical</em> attribute is one that, if it degrades, is much more   significant in terms of being an indicator of <em>imminent </em>electromechanical failure. While any attribute that changes from &quot;healthy&quot;   to &quot;fail&quot; is a bad thing, a failure on a critical attribute is much more   serious, and much more likely to result in near-term failure. WindowSMART   also regards a subset of attributes as <em>super-critical </em>attributes, where   even small changes in them trigger at least a warning, whether or not the   threshold is violated.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><strong>Q:</strong> What are the <em>super-critical</em> attributes? Why are   they &quot;super&quot; critical?<br />
  <strong>A:</strong> The <em>super-critical</em> attributes are reallocated (bad) sector count, spin retry count, end-to-end   error, reallocation event count, pending bad sector count, uncorrectable sector   count (aka offline uncorrectable sector count) and ultra DMA CRC error count. Super-critical attributes for SSDs vary by SSD controller manufacturer. With the exception of the CRC, the <em>super-critical </em>attributes are ones   that, if they degrade, can result in an imminent degradation and/or total   failure of the disk. Of all attributes, these are the most significant ones to   pay attention to, especially if they start to degrade. The CRC error is much   less serious; if it starts showing up, most likely it's the result of a   defective data cable or failing disk controller. Both a defective cable or   failing controller can cause data loss and therefore this attribute receives   special attention.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><strong>Q:</strong> Can I reset SMART attributes on a   disk?<br />
  <strong>A:</strong> No, that would be like rolling back an odometer in   a car.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><strong>Q:</strong> I had one or more bad sectors appear, but it's been   months since it happened and the drive has worked fine since. Is the disk   okay?<br />
  <strong>A:</strong> Bad sectors are never a &quot;good&quot; thing, but if they   appeared and the drive has functioned flawlessly since then for an extended   period of time (at least several months), and that disk has been subjected to   significant I/O activity, there's a reasonably good chance that the bad   sector(s) were a &quot;fluke&quot; (a manufacturing defect, perhaps?) and the drive may   function fine for a long time. Keep an eye on it from time to time to be sure it   doesn't get worse. If the disk in question is an SSD, bad or &quot;retired&quot; sectors are not as critical, as sector retirement is a normal part of an SSD's media wearout.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><strong>Q:</strong> Lately a disk has been making a high-pitched squealing   sound. It may occur at spin-up, intermittently during normal operation or   sometimes continuously. The SMART data all looks good. Should I be   concerned?<br />
  <strong>A:</strong> This sound is often associated with the   bearings on the disk starting to wear out. It could be an early indicator of   trouble. I've seen disks in this condition function for years, but it shouldn't   be taken lightly. Keep a close eye on the disk and if the sounds get worse,   replace the disk even if SMART says all is well.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><strong>Q:</strong> My disk is making clicking, clunking, grinding and   scraping noises. What's wrong?<br />
  <strong>A:</strong> Your disk has probably   already failed if you're hearing this. If not, and you can still access the   disk, try backing up any valuable data. If you cannot access the disk, you   should shut it down immediately and, if you still need to recover the data, you   may need to secure the services of a data recovery company. The disk has likely   suffered a <em>head crash</em> or other serious electromechanical failure and   continued operation will likely cause further damage and data destruction.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><strong>Q:</strong> What is a <em>head crash</em>?<br />
  <strong>A:</strong> The   read/write heads on a hard disk float a microscopic distance above the disk   surface. While the disk platters are spinning (typically at 5400, 7200, 10000 or   15000 RPM), the heads should <em>never </em>touch the disk surface. If they do,   even if for a mere fraction of a second, the event is called a <em>head   crash</em>. This is a catastrophic situation. In the best case, only one or two   sectors will have been immediately affected, but oftentimes many (dozens or even   hundreds) of sectors are destroyed, and the read/write head itself could be   damaged. Magnetic oxide particles and other debris will now be flying around   within the disk chamber, which can cause subsequent head crashes. Oftentimes   when a head crash occurs, the disk will fail immediately. If it doesn't, total   failure is not uncommon within minutes or hours.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><strong>Q:</strong> A hard drive failed. SMART didn't report a single   problem, and WindowSMART rated the disk as <em>Healthy</em>. What   happened?<br />
  <strong>A:</strong> SMART is imperfect, and cannot predict   every failure. SMART can predict many electromechanical failures, but   sometimes the failure occurs within a chip on the disk's onboard controller (the   circuit board attached to the disk) or the disk's power supply. Unfortunately,   SMART is not perfect, and many disks will fail inexplicably without any   kind of warning. One minute they're working fine and the next minute they're   dead. By contrast, SMART can report that a disk's failure is imminent (the   SMART specification states that a failure will occur within 24 hours of an   attribute threshold being violated), and yet the disk will continue to function   normally for years.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><strong>Q:</strong> What does it mean that a threshold is violated? What is   TEC, or T.E.C.?<br />
  <strong>A:</strong> For every SMART attribute there are   two key numbers that people pay attention to. One is the Threshold, and the   other is the (normalized) Value. If the Threshold is nonzero (a health   attribute), and the number in the Value field falls so that it is less than or   equal to the Threshold, the attribute is said to have <em>failed</em>. Other   terms for this include <em>threshold violation</em>, or more commonly, <em>Threshold Exceeds Condition</em>, commonly known as TEC or T.E.C. An   attribute that has a Threshold of zero can never fail. (WindowSMART can   still flag an attribute as <em>Degraded</em>, even if the Threshold is zero, if   the attribute is a <em>super-critical</em> attribute.) Attributes that have   zero thresholds are considered age attributes, instead of health attributes. <em>Super-critical </em>attributes are <em>always</em> considered when   calculating a disk's health, whether or not they have zero thresholds.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><strong>Q:</strong> What happens if an attribute's value falls to zero? What   is a <em>geriatric </em>disk?<br />
  <strong>A:</strong> If this happens, and the   Threshold is zero, WindowSMART considers the attribute to be <em>geriatric</em>. In other words, this condition is a sign of <em>old   age</em>. Put simply, in the eyes of the manufacturer, the disk has met or   exceeded its expected life expectancy for that particular attribute. For   example, a manufacturer may rate a disk for 1,000,000 power cycles. They may set   a threshold of zero and a normalized value of 100. For every 1,000 power cycles,   that normalized value is decreased by one. So when the one millionth power cycle   is reached, the threshold reaches zero. Sure the drive can function beyond that,   but to the manufacturer, the disk is &quot;living on borrowed time.&quot; WindowSMART does not consider a <em>geriatric disk</em> to be a problem, particularly   if the disk is not exhibiting any other more serious problems.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><strong>Q:</strong> How is the temperature calculated? The value reported in   the Raw Data is clearly enormous, and yet a &quot;reasonable&quot; temperature is   reported.<br />
  <strong>A:</strong> The &quot;lowest order&quot; two bytes are used. In the   main window, these are the right-most two hexadecimal digits. If you see &quot;3E&quot;   for example, this converts to decimal 62, which is 62 degrees Celsius. Depending   on your temperature display (i.e. Fahrenheit), you may see a different number.   For temperature and airflow temperature, the two right-most digits are always   used, and this always converts to Celsius (WindowSMART converts the Celsius value for   visual display, if you've configured a different temperature display). The   lowest value that can be reported is zero (00) and the highest is 255 (FF).</p>
<p class="BodyText"><strong>Q:</strong> The number of bad sectors, pending sectors, end-to-end   errors, etc. is nonzero in Raw Data, and yet WindowSMART is not reporting   any problems. Why is this?<br />
  <strong>A:</strong>  The &quot;lowest order&quot; four bytes   are used. In the main window, these are the right-most four hexadecimal digits.    The other 8 digits are not used (the vendor may store other data here).  The   lowest number of these events is thus zero (0000) and can be as high as 65,535   (FFFF).</p>
<p class="BodyText"><strong>Q:</strong> Is it possible for a SMART attribute to fail, and then   &quot;un-fail&quot;?<br />
  <strong>A:</strong> Yes. The best example I can think of is   Airflow Temperature on Seagate hard drives. I have several of these that ran hot   and the threshold was violated (Value 44, Threshold 45), but when the disks   cooled off, the Value went back above 45.  Of course the value of the Worst   field remained at 44, a forever reminder that the attribute had &quot;failed&quot; at one   time.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><strong>Q:</strong> Does WindowSMART use the value of Worst in any of   its calculations?<br />
  <strong>A:</strong> Other than display purposes, no. If an   attribute failed and then &quot;un-failed&quot; (its value increased above its threshold),   you will have events in the event log indicating such. Otherwise, no action is   taken.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><strong>Q:</strong>I have a Solid State Disk, and it has a bunch of attributes being reported as Geriatric. The disk is brand new. Why is it geriatric already?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Unlike hard disk manufacturers, which for the most part use the same set of SMART attributes, with only a handful of variations, SSD <em>controller </em>manufacturers have each implemented their own set of attributes, although there are similarities between many of them. As new SSDs are introduced, they may not have the same attribute set as their predecessors. WindowSMART checks to see whether a disk is an SSD, and then checks what attributes it is exposing. This is how an SSD's controller is identified, and then an appropriate set of attributes is displayed. If a new SSD utilizes a different set of attributes from any others, then WindowSMART is unable to match it to a controller manufacturer, and so instead of displaying nothing, it displays HDD attributes. New releases of WindowSMART will attempt to address these as they arise. Please enable debug logging and then submit a <a href="https://www.dojonorthsoftware.net/bugtraq" title="Bug Report" target="_blank">bug report</a>. Don't forget to include the debug logs.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><strong>Q:</strong> Do you support hardware RAID? What about SAS disks?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> At the present time, we do not support hardware RAID arrays. This is something we would like to address in a future release, but this will be a significant undertaking. As for SAS disks, or disks connected to any CSMI-based controller (or updated drivers that use CSMI instructions), these are supported as of the June 2013 release (version 3.1.6.8 and later). This includes the latest Intel RST drivers.</p>
