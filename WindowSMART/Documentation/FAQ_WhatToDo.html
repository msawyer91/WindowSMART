<p class="PageTitle">What Do I Do When a Failure is Predicted?</p>
<p class="BodyText">Hard drives can and do die, as do Solid State Disks. Some may last for a great many years and still be   good when you replace them with newer models, whereas others could die within   hours of purchase. Some will raise red flags aplenty that they're about to go,   and others will die suddenly, without warning.</p>
<p class="BodyText">There is no realistic way that WindowSMART, or any other tool, can tell   you exactly when a disk is going to fail. When the SMART specification was   created, they defined Threshold Exceeds Condition (TEC) as one whereby a disk   would fail within 24 hours of TEC occurrence.Â  In other words, if any <em>normalized value</em> fell to less than the <em>non-zero threshold</em>,   failure was imminent (24 hours or less). In reality, some disks can have several   attributes showing TEC and they survive for years. Others can show flawless   operating conditions one minute and be completely dead the next. SMART is an   imperfect technology, and vendors have a wide degree of latitude in how they   implement it. Some vendors may only tolerate a handful of a specific condition   before triggering TEC while others may tolerate a lot of a certain condition   before throwing in the towel.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Bad sectors are a good example. It's possible for some disks trigger TEC on attribue   5 (Bad Sectors) with as few as 50 bad sectors. Others have been closer to 500   before signaling failure.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Only you can make the ultimate decision on what to do. This help text is   intended to provide you with suggestions on how to proceed when a disk is   starting to misbehave. The ultimate goal is to get the disk replaced before it   fails, so you don't lose any data.</p>
<p class="SubTitle">Back Up, Back Up, Back Up</p>
<p class="BodyText">The best strategry to avoid data loss is to back up your data! Large capacity external disks are readily available, and there are many other home storage options such as home servers and NAS devices. Other options include online/cloud-based backup services such as Carbonite or Mozy, which provide generous storage for a small fee. There are additional options, many of which are free, although the free plans generally have much smaller limits. Nevertheless they can make useful backup locations; these include but are not limited to Sky Drive, Dropbox, box and iCloud.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Regular backups are your most powerful weapon against disk failure. If backup space is a concern, remember you only need to back up your <em>data </em>and non-replacable downloads. Media that you have on disc such as the operating system or Microsoft Office don't need to be backed up, and this can save you many GB of space.</p>
<p class="BodyText">WindowSMART 2015 can initiate an emergency backup if a failure is detected. However, this backup capability should be regarded as a last resort backup, not your first line of defense!</p>
<p class="SubTitle">Fail and &quot;Un-Fail&quot; - An Airflow Problem?</p>
<p class="BodyText">The<em> normalized value</em> of an attribute is a numeric value that can go   up and down. The<em> worst value</em> usually only goes down, typically   reflecting the lowest value (typically the &quot;worst&quot;) to which the normalized   value has ever fallen. The<em> threshold</em> is constant and never changes.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Because the normalized value can rise and fall, it is perfectly possible for   a value to fall equal to or less than its threshold, and then rise above it   again. This means a disk can actually enter a failure condition, and then come   back to a healthy state.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><strong>IN MOST CASES</strong>, disk failure prediction (TEC) is a one-way   street. Bad sectors, end-to-end errors, reallocation event count, etc. are all   examples of values that can only get worse, and never better.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><strong>Temperature</strong> and<strong> Airflow Temperature</strong> are   examples of attributes that can<em> fail</em> and then<em> un-fail</em>. Most   disks I've encountered that implement both temperature and airflow temperature   will have a zero threshold for temperature but a non-zero threshold for airflow   temperature. I have, on numerous occasions, had disks run too hot and the   airflow temperature signals TEC, and after cooling the disk the value climbs   back above the threshold, returning the disk to a healthy state. The <em>worst </em>value, however, remains at the lowest the normalized value has ever fallen,   a reminder of the problem that occurred.</p>
<p class="BodyText">If you have disks that are generating TEC and then coming back to healthy,   and the generating conditions are temperature-related, more likely than not you   don't have a <em>disk </em>problem, but rather an <em>airflow </em>problem. Of   course, an airflow problem can become a disk problem if the disks are allowed to   operate in excessively hot conditions for extended periods of time.</p>
<p class="BodyText">In my case, the home server is in the basement which is relatively cool and   maintains constant temperature year-round. But when I added some additional   external disks, I put them in the same spot as the existing ones, meaning I had   to bunch the disks closer together. Previously they had 4-6 inches between them;   now they only have an inch or two. This was enough to get them running too hot,   as they were close enough together and, without anything to move the air (i.e. a   fan), they started overheating. Setting up a small fan on low speed was enough   to rein in the overheating, although rather than wasting electricity on running   a fan, I will need to re-think my setup and move the disks around for better   spacing and airflow.</p>
<p class="SubTitle">WindowSMART vs. Vendor Tools</p>
<p class="BodyText">You may wonder why WindowSMART considers your disk to be   critical, and yet when you run the manufacturer's provided diagnostic tools   (i.e. SeaTools for Seagate), it says the disk is fine.</p>
<p class="BodyText">The first thing to bear in mind is that each vendor's tools should be able to   interpret<em> every raw value</em> for<em> all</em> of its disks. They have   likely specified tolerances (an allowable number of certain errors) before the   diagnostic signals failure. A disk that has violated a threshold (TEC) should   definitely cause the vendor diagnostic tool to raise an error and thus return a   failure code to you.</p>
<p class="BodyText">A vendor may consider 250 bad sectors to be acceptable, while WindowSMART signals Critical. Bad sectors are often a problem that continue to get   worse, so WindowSMART will raise the red flag. WindowSMART is designed to<em> err on the side of   caution</em> and give you advance warning of a problem, rather than signaling   you only once the problem has turned into a disaster. WindowSMART provides you the   ability to ignore certain problems--the premise here being one of<em> watchful   waiting</em>. If the problem doesn't get worse, it lies dormant and WindowSMART doesn't   trigger any alerts. If it gets worse, however, WindowSMART will let you know.</p>
<p class="SubTitle">Disks Under Warranty</p>
<p class="BodyText">If the disk is under warranty, and TEC has occurred, it should definitely   fail vendor diagnostics. Get the data off of the disk and RMA it as soon as   possible. If TEC has not occurred, but WindowSMART is signaling Critical,   you should make a note of which attribute(s) are generating the alert(s). Run   the vendor diagnostic tool. If the tool signals failure, you can RMA the disk.   If the tool says the disk is healhty, however, you should still contact the   vendor (you'll probably have to call their technical support line) and provide   them the data shown to you in the WindowSMART console. Vendors<em> may</em> accept this   as proof of failure. They are not obliged to do so however, unless their   diagnostic tool specifically says there is a failure.</p>
<p class="SubTitle">Out of Warranty</p>
<p class="BodyText">If your disk is out of warranty, it doesn't matter to your pocketbook whether   or not TEC has occurred. Out-of-warranty disks cannot be RMAed and so you're   going to have to buy a new one. Unless there is a product recall or class action   lawsuit over a manufacturer producing a lot (or several lots) of bad drives,   you're out of luck in terms of replacement cost.</p>
<p class="BodyText">If you can afford it, and you are willing to buy a new one, you certainly   should replace the disk, especially if it is a TEC condition, or a non-TEC   condition that keeps getting worse (increasing bad sectors, repeated end-to-end   errors, etc.). If replacement cost is an issue, you may be tempted to ride it   out as long as possible until the financial situation improves. If you choose   this path,<strong> closely monitor</strong> the disk for any indication of a   worsening problem. If the problem appears to be an isolated incident and doesn't   worsen, watchful waiting may be a good approach. If the problem continues to   worsen, however, you should <strong>strongly consider</strong> either replacing   the disk, or at the very least making sure you back up the data on it and keep those backups current.</p>
