<p class="Welcome">Welcome to WindowSMART 2015!</p>
<p class="BodyText">Dojo North Software's WindowSMART 2015 Help is designed to provide you a ready means to answer your questions about the WindowSMART software, from how to use it to what various statuses and messages mean. The WindowSMART help is provided in the form of a compiled HTML (CHM) help file, which consists of several tabs to make it easy to find what it is you're looking for.</p>
<ul>
  <li class="UnorderedListHeader"><strong class="UnorderedListHeader">Contents Tab: </strong><span class="UnorderedListItem">This tab displays the contents of the help file as books, or chapters. As you expand a book, it can contain one or more chapters (denoted by book icons), and each chapter contains one or more topics (denoted by page icons). The purpose of the chapters, is to organize relevant content together. This makes it easy to navigate from one chapter to the next, and if you're searching by chapter, you can find the desired content in a logical place</span>.</li>
  <li class="UnorderedListHeader">Index Tab: <span class="UnorderedListItem">This tab displays a list of keywords and phrases. If you're looking for a specific term, you can quickly scan through this topic list. Once you find the topic you want, double-click on it to display the desired page.</span></li>
  <li class="UnorderedListHeader">Search Tab: <span class="UnorderedListItem">This tab allows you to search for any term, whether or not the term is listed in the Index tab. All pages in the help file that contain your search term will be displayed, and you can double-click on the desired page to bring it up.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class="BodyText">WindowSMART 2015 is a Shareware application. This means that you are free to use the software for a limited period of time (30 days), after which you must either &quot;register&quot; it (purchase a license for a fee) or uninstall the software from your computer. Please see the Pricing section of this help. During the WindowSMART public beta, registration is not required, but donations are welcome. Those who donate will receive a license comensurate with their donation when WindowSMART is released as a final product.</p>
<p class="BodyText">WindowSMART 2015 can be installed on 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) versions of Windows. Per the WindowSMART license agreement, you must be running a genuine, lawfully licensed installation of Windows. Running WindowSMART on a non-genuine, pirated or counterfeit version of Windows constitutes an egregious violation of the WindowSMART license agreement, regardless of whether you paid the registration fee.</p>
