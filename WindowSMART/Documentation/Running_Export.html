<p class="PageTitle">Export Results</p>
<p class="BodyText">Some users may wish to export the disk details and SMART results to a file for posting to a blog or forum, or for later analysis. WindowSMART provides you with several different export options. Each option exports the same data, but allows you to select the formatting. You can choose the formatting method that best suits the intended use.</p>
<p class="BodyText">You can export to an HTML file, a text file, a comma-separated values (CSV) file or a tab-separated values (TSV) file.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Included in every export is the machine and operating system details as well as the disk's physical characteristics. If the SMART data is available, that too is exported. Some disks support self-tests as well. If the self-test data is available, that too is displayed, as well as the run-times for items such as short and extended self-tests.</p>
<p class="SubTitle">HTML</p>
<p class="BodyText">An HTML export generates a nicely-formatted HTML file, broken down into machine/operating system, physical disk characteristics and SMART details. HTML tables and colors are used to format and highlight the data. This format is recommended if you want to print the data or upload it to a forum that supports embedded HTML.</p>
<p class="SubTitle">Text</p>
<p class="BodyText">A text file export is the simplest export format, with no special formatting characters. All of the text is laid out with spaces inserted to ensure the various items line up nicely. If you plan on uploading your exported data to a forum that doesn't support special formatting (i.e. HTML or colors), this is the best format to use.</p>
<p class="SubTitle">Comma- and Tab-Separated Values (CSV/TSV)</p>
<p class="BodyText">Comma- and Tab-Separated Values (CSV/TSV) exports are recommended for users who intend to load the results into a spreadsheet such as Excel, OpenOffice.org Calc, or Apple's Numbers. If you plan to analyze the data or generate charts or graphs, the CSV or TSV format is the best choice. Functionally these two formats are identical, with the exception of the separator character (CSVs use commas; TSVs use tabs). Both export formats are provided so you can use the format you prefer, or the one that is supported by your spreadsheet software.</p>
