<p class="PageTitle">WindowSMART 2015 Overview</p>
<p class="BodyText">WindowSMART 2015 is a desktop client for Microsoft Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8, although it can also be run on Windows Server 2003, 2008, 2008 R2 and 2012. Both 32-bit and 64-bit (x86 and x64) editions of the aforementioned operating systems are supported; however the Itanium (ia64) platform is not.
<p class="BodyText">WindowSMART 2015, once installed, continuously monitors the health of your hard disks via Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology, or S.M.A.R.T. (hereafter referred to simply as &quot;SMART&quot;). Hard Disk Drives (HDDs), as well as Solid State Disks (SSDs), that support SMART are able to report health information about one or more <em>attributes </em>that indicate the health condition of the disk. WindowSMART can read SMART data from most SATA/eSATA and IDE disk controllers in desktops and laptops, provided they are not configured as RAID  (unless the disks themselves are configured as standalone). Disks configured as arrays on a hardware RAID adapter cannot be analyzed by WindowSMART. WindowSMART can also collect SMART information from many disks attached to USB and FireWire (IEEE 1394) enclosures.
<p class="BodyText">WindowSMART uses a variety of methods to read SMART data from disks. The type of disk controller (IDE/SATA vs. USB) will determine which method(s) are used. Silicon Image (SiI) controllers often require special APIs to read data from them. The preferred, and faster, way to retrieve SMART data is through native Windows API calls, which are implemented by most vendor storage drivers, and this is the only option for USB/FireWire. For IDE and SATA/eSATA, if the API call fails, WindowSMART will attempt to get the information through Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). WMI is slower, but is often successful and thus makes a good backup to collect the information. Hardware RAID arrays use vendor proprietary APIs, which is why WindowSMART does not support them (although this is something to hopefully appear in a future release).
<p class="BodyText">SMART data can reveal a number of things about a disk, such as how many hours it has been running, whether or not it has developed bad sectors, temperature and more. While SMART is technically a &quot;standard,&quot; vendors have a wide degree of latitude in how many, and which, attributes they implement on a given drive and how they report them. It is not uncommon for two different disk models from the same manufacturer to have different sets of attributes.
<p class="BodyText">Solid State Disks use a different set of SMART attributes, and these vary radically between the SSD controller manufacturers. While attributes for HDDs have become fairly standard (and consistent) between HDD manufacturers, SSD attributes are hardly standardized; rather, they seem to be evolving with SSDs. Compared to HDDs, SSDs are a very young technology and there are likely many changes to come.
<p class="BodyText">WindowSMART collects and analyzes the attributes from each disk that reports them, and displays them in an easy-to-understand table. For each attribute, WindowSMART will indicate if it detects a problem. Some problems are serious and could indicate a disk that is ready to fail; others are minor such as a high temperature that can be easily remedied. WindowSMART will also suggest corrective action(s) as appropriate. If a disk is running hot for too long a time, WindowSMART can optionally shut down the computer.
<p class="BodyText">Because you cannot be in front of your computer viewing the WindowSMART console, WindowSMART runs as a Windows service, continuously monitoring the health of your disks on an interval you specify (default is every 3 minutes). You can configure notifications so that you can be notified anytime, anywhere, should a problem arise. All users can configure email alerting, which will send alerts to up to three recipients. Users who have Apple or Android devices such as an iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, Droid 4, Droid Bionic or HP TouchPad can select to receive instant notifications via Prowl (iOS) or Notify My Android. You can enable alerts on all of these, so if a problem occurs, you will receive email as well as Prowl and NMA notifications.
<p class="BodyText">WindowSMART 2015 can attempt to back up the data from a disk that is signaling failure. You can back up to a local disk or to a remote share on another computer, and also run a third-party backup program (the latter two options are available in the Professional edition only). If you choose to back up using WindowSMART's built-in backup capability, you need to select at least one folder to back up. To back up an entire disk, select the root folder. For a faster backup, select only the folder(s) you consider to be most important--typically data that is irreplacable. There normally is little or no need to back up Windows itself or program files; on the other hand, items like documents, photos and videos should be included in your backup.
<p class="BodyText"><strong>CAUTION</strong>: SMART is an imperfect technology, and it is perfectly possible for a disk to be functioning flawlessly one minute, and fail catastrophically the next. By the same token, a disk could be reporting a failure state on multiple attributes, and yet the disk will continue to function without trouble for five more years. These are extreme examples, but it is important to be aware that neither Dojo North Software nor SMART make any guarantees or promises about the safety of your data. You are responsible for the safety of your data, and should have a good backup and disaster recovery plan in place should a disk fail.
  
While WindowSMART does possess a backup capability, this is a last resort backup capability. If a disk is signaling failure, it is possible the disk could fail during the backup. Don't use WindowSMART's backup as your sole backup. Have a good backup strategy in place, and use WindowSMART as an <strong>extra</strong> backup--a safety net.
