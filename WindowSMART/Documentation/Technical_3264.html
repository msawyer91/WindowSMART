<p class="PageTitle">32- or 64-bit?</p>
<p class="BodyText">WindowSMART 2015 is written using mostly Microsoft C#, specifically under the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0. All of the modules were compiled in a mode called MSIL, known in the development environment as &quot;Any CPU.&quot; This means that the modules will happily run in 32- and 64-bit versions of Microsoft Windows, and will adapt themselves to whichever bit level Windows is running. If Windows is 64-bit, WindowSMART will run as 64-bit.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Not all of the code was written in C#, however. Some of it was written in &quot;unmanaged&quot; or &quot;native&quot; code, specifically using Microsoft Visual C++ 2010. C++ code cannot be compiled into MSIL or Any CPU. You must choose whether to compile as 32- or 64-bit. For this reason, the bit level of the C++ modules must match the bit level of the C# modules. Since MSIL modules run at the bit level of the OS, the C++ must match them, otherwise they will not communicate with each other.</p>
<p class="BodyText">That said, you should make sure if you are running 64-bit Windows that you choose the 64-bit installer for WindowSMART 2015. It is technically possible to install the 32-bit version, and it may appear to work correctly, but in fact it is not. It is impossible to install the 64-bit version on 32-bit Windows.</p>
<p class="BodyText">If you install the 32-bit version of WindowSMART 2015 on 64-bit Windows, the following behaviors will be evident due to the failure of WindowSMART's communications with the 32-bit C++ library:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="UnorderedListItem">Identification of SSDs will fail; all SSDs will be treated as HDDs
    <ul>
      <li>Incorrect attributes will be reported for SSDs</li>
      <li>SSDs will, at best, show a health status of Geriatric</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="UnorderedListItem">SMART data will not be available for any USB or FireWire devices</li>
  <li class="UnorderedListItem">SMART data that is available will be entirely retrieved through WMI fallback mode</li>
  <li class="UnorderedListItem">Debug logs, if enabled, will be littered with HRESULT exceptions on all P/Invoke calls</li>
</ul>
<p class="BodyText">If you notice the above described behavior, please uninstall WindowSMART 2015, download the 64-bit version and reinstall.</p>
