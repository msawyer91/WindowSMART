<p class="PageTitle">Customizing WindowSMART 2015</p>
<p class="BodyText">WindowSMART 2015 provides you with a variety of items you can customize. While some items customize the UI, most actually dictate how the service behaves and how problems are detected and reported.
<p class="SubTitle">General Tab</p>
<p class="BodyText">The General settings allow you to specify how often Home Server SMART polls   your disks for S.M.A.R.T. data. The polling not only fetches this data, but   performs a health assessment of the data. The default polling interval is 3   minutes; you can set it as little as 1 minute or as many as 10800 minutes (1 week). Alerts are generated, updated or cleared only when the service polls the   disks, so setting this unnecessarily high is discouraged.</p>
<p class="BodyText">The high polling interval is allowed at the request of the user community, mainly from users who wish to allow their drives to sleep for extended periods. Disks are awakened whenever they are polled for SMART data. You should exercise caution when setting this to a high value, as it could possibly allow a problem to develop and fester for days before it is detected.</p>
<p class="BodyText">You also have the option of ignoring certain problems. You can ignore Warning alerts, as well as Geriatric  alerts. A Geriatric alert occurs when one or more SMART attributes on a disk reach their zero threshold. These attributes cannot technically fail, since the value cannot be less than the zero threshold. Rather, this is an indication that the drive may have exceeded its design specification.</p>
<p class="SubTitle">Temperatures Tab</p>
<p class="BodyText">WindowSMART allows you to customize how it handles the temperatures of   your disks. You can choose how temperatures are displayed in the UI (Celsius (default), Fahrenheit or Kelvin), and also define the thresholds for temperature criticallity. You can also choose whether to ignore alerts that arise when a Warm or Hot condition is detected. A checkbox to allow Overheated disks is visible, but is always dimmed.</p>
<ul>
  <li class="BodyText"><strong>Critical</strong> - an extremely hot temperature that would likely   cause damage to a disk in a short period of time (i.e. minutes or hours). A disk   is considered critically hot at a Celsius temperature of 65 or higher (149 °F). </li>
  <li class="BodyText"><strong>Overheated</strong> - a very hot temperature that would likely cause   damage to a disk if allowed to operate for a moderate period of time (i.e.   days). A disk is considered overheated at a Celsius temperature of 55 or higher   (131 °F), but less than 65 °C. </li>
  <li class="BodyText"><strong>Hot</strong> - a hot temperature that may cause damage to a disk,   particularly if allowed to operate at that temperature continuously for extended   periods (typically weeks or longer). A disk is considered hot at a Celsius   temperature of 50 or higher (122 °F), but less than 55 °C. </li>
  <li class="BodyText"><strong>Warm</strong> - a cautionary level which may not be a problem, but   something to keep an eye on, especially if the disk never used to run too warm   before. A disk is considered warm at a Celsius temperature of 42 or higher (107   °F), but less than 50 °C. </li>
</ul>
<p class="BodyText">The temperatures listed above are the defaults, but you are welcome to change   any or all of the values. The lowest allowed temperature is 35 °C
and the highest allowed is 70 °C.
<p class="BodyText">Sometimes temperature sensors malfunction and report unrealistically hot values. WindowSMART considers 91 °C to be the <em>absurdity threshold</em>. This means that if a temperature sensor reports a temperature that is higher than 90 °C (91 °C or higher), the temperature reading is assumed to be <em>absurd </em>or <em>unrealistic</em>. A warning indicator will appear in the UI, but an alert will not be generated. Most computer electronics, including CPUs, hard drives, memory chips and SSDs would have fried before reaching that temperature.
<p class="BodyText">If you are running the Professional edition of WindowSMART (when in trial mode, Professional features are available), you have the option of initiating a thermal shutdown of the computer. If WindowSMART detects any one disk is running at an overheated or critically hot temperature for three or more consecutive polling intervals, it can shut down the computer. By default, this option is disabled. For best results, you should use a polling interval in the range of 5-20 minutes, as this would capture a disk that is extremely hot in an ideal time period (15-60 minutes).
<p class="SubTitle">Ignored Items Tab</p>
<p class="BodyText">The Ignored Items tab allows you to view problems and disks that you may have ignored previously. For ignored problems, you are shown the disk on which they appear, the problem in question and the number of times it was detected. For disks, you are shown any ignored disks, as well as the date you started ignoring the disk.</p>
<p class="BodyText">For both ignored disks and problems, you can select an individual item and resume monitoring it; you can also resume monitoring for all ignored disks and all ignored problems.</p>
<p class="BodyText">There is also an option &quot;Never enumerate known virtual disks.&quot; This deliberately hides known virtual (non-physical) disks, including those created by disk pooling software (Drive Bender, StableBit DrivePool), Virtual Box, Hyper-V and others. Enumerating some virtual disks can actually cause problems and unexpected errors. Since these disks do not possess SMART characteristics, there is little reason to display them in the UI anyway. You can click the Edit List button to add or remove entries from the list of known virtual disks.</p>
<p class="SubTitle">Service Control Tab</p>
<p class="BodyText">The Service Control tab allows you to start, stop and restart the WindowSMART service. In most cases you should not need to do this, but if you believe there is a problem with the service or you have changed the logging location, you are able to manipulate the service as necessary.</p>
<p class="BodyText">This tab also provides you with the ability to reboot or shut down the computer. To prevent accidental clicking of the reboot and shut down buttons, you must click the Enable checkbox next to them. Even then, when you click the button to reboot or shut down, you are presented with a confirmation. You can optionally force running processes to exit, useful if you believe a process on the computer is hung and causing mischief, allowing Windows to try forcing it to quit.</p>
<p class="SubTitle">Notify Tab</p>
<p class="BodyText">The Notify tab allows you to configure remote alerting. WindowSMART can provide you with alerts via email as well as instant notifications via four services: Boxcar and Prowl for iOS, Notify My Android, and Toasty for Windows Phone 7.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Email notifications, when enabled, must be sent to at least one recipient, and can be sent to up to three separate recipients. You must specify email addresses for both the sender and recipient(s), as well as mail server, port and whether or not credentials are required. You are presented with an option to send a test message. The Email Configuration dialogue will validate settings for correctness if email alerts are enabled, and will prevent you from saving invalid data.</p>
<p class="BodyText">If you have an iPhone, Android or Windows phone, you can receive instant notification when problems are detected. iOS users can download the Boxcar and/or Prowl app from the iTunes App Store,  Android users can download Notify My Android from Google Play, and Windows Phone users can download Toasty from the Marketplace. All apps, with the exception of Boxcar, are available from their respective stores for a modest fee. Boxcar is ad-supported but is otherwise free of charge, unless you choose to pay for the &quot;disable advertising&quot; in-app purchase.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Both Prowl and NMA require you to provide an API Key, which you can request for free from their respective websites. When a notification is sent to your API Key, the notification appears on all of your devices with the appropriate client installed. Both Prowl and NMA allow you to have an unlimited number of API keys. Boxcar uses your email address for notifications. Toasty generates a unique Device ID, which you should use for notifications.</p>
<p class="BodyText">If you would like multiple people to receive Prowl or NMA alerts (or both), you can specify up to five (5) API Keys each for Prowl and NMA. Just separate the keys with commas (no spaces). If you send alerts to multiple API keys belonging to the same person, they will receive the same alert multiple times. Specifying multiple API keys is recommendd for sending alerts to <em>different </em>people, not the same person. Boxcar and Toasty allow a theoretically limitless number of recipients.</p>
<p class="BodyText">To get a Prowl API Key, visit <a href="http://www.prowlapp.com" target="_blank">http://www.prowlapp.com</a>. To get an NMA API Key, visit <a href="http://nma.usk.bz/" target="_blank">http://nma.usk.bz/</a>.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Boxcar and Prowl is designed for iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch, and requires iOS 3.1 or later. NMA requires Android 2.2 or later and can be installed on Android phones and tablets, including mods such as the HP TouchPad. Toasty requires Windows Phone 7.5 or later.</p>
<p class="SubTitle">Advanced Tab</p>
<p class="BodyText">The Advanced tab provides features for cleaning up old data, restoring defaults and configuring debugging. These functions are typically meant for advanced users, but all users can benefit if there is a problem.</p>
<p class="BodyText">The Delete Stale button allows you to clean out &quot;stale&quot; disk data. If you've removed disks (including flash drives or media card readers) from your computer and you have no intention of ever reinstalling them, you can help de-clutter the WindowSMART data saved in the Registry. A disk is considered &quot;stale&quot; only if it wasn't present the most recent time the service was started. Click the Delete Stale button and confirm you want to delete the data, and you will be informed if any stale data was present, and how many stale disks were removed.</p>
<p class="BodyText">There are two Reset options: Restore Defaults and Reset EVERYTHING. Restore defaults restores all WindowSMART settings to their defaults, but does NOT delete any saved disk information, including ignored disks and ignored problems. This is meant for simply restoring configuration values to their default settings, particularly if you changed a setting but can't remember what you changed and you want to put it back.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Reset EVERYTHING also restores all defaults, but it also deletes all saved disk information, and restores the configuration to the way it was the very first time you installed WindowSMART. This should only be done in extreme cases where you're having problems with WindowSMART and nothing else works at fixing the problem.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Debugging options are intended for troubleshooting purposes and in most cases should be left alone. The debugging options are:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="BodyText">Use WMI when P/Invoke fails - WindowSMART by default falls back to WMI to attempt to get SMART data from a disk if the preferred (P/Invoke) method fails. If you don't want WMI to be used, uncheck this box. It is recommended to leave this checked.</li>
  <li class="BodyText">Try zero threshold method on SiI if primary method fails - Some Silicon Image controllers return SMART data but not thresholds. By default WindowSMART displays these disks as &quot;unknown.&quot; If you would like to show the SMART data with all zero thresholds, which technically may result in incorrect data being displayed, check this box. If SMART data is available, it will be shown.</li>
  <li class="BodyText">Enable SmartInspect logging - WindowSMART can generate detailed debug log files to aid in troubleshooting and debugging. By default this box is unchecked and should only be checked if you would like to see the debug logs or you have been asked to do so by Dojo North Software. (During the public beta, this box is checked and cannot be disabled.)
    <ul>
      <li>Logging Location: Default location is C:\ProgramData\Dojo North Software\Logs. If this location is on an SSD, you should change it to an HDD, since the logging involves a significant amount of writing. Note also that the C:\ProgramData folder is a hidden folder and by default isn't visible in Windows Explorer. If you change the logging location, you must restart the WindowSMART service (and the UI) for the changes to take effect. Both the service and the UI generate their own log files.  </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="SubTitle">SSD Tab</p>
<p class="BodyText">Solid State Disks have media wearout/life remaining indicators, which are represented as a percentage from 0-100 or 1-100. WindowSMARt allows you to customize at what percentage a disk should be flagged as being in a Warning or a Critical state. By default, a disk will go Critical when the life remaining is 10% or less, and Warning at 30% or less.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Valid critical ranges are 1-20%. Valid warning ranges are 21-50%.</p>
<p class="BodyText">You can also customize the Sector Retirement/Reallocation critical and warning thresholds. Because SSDs are not mechanical, the presence of a retired (or bad) sector is not necessarily indicative of imminent catastrophic failure. Rather, sector retirement is a normal part of an SSD's life as the media is written over and over and begins to wear out. For this reason, WindowSMART allows a much higher number of sectors to retire before triggering a warning or critical state; the same is also true for reallocation events. On an HDD, as little as one bad sector will trigger a Warning state; on an SSD, the default is 50 retired (bad) sectors. Critical status is reached at 150 retired sectors.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Valid critical ranges are 50-500 retired sectors and/or reallocation events. Valid warning ranges are 5-100 retired sectors and/or reallocation events.</p>
<p class="SubTitle">Updates Tab</p>
<p class="BodyText">The Updates tab allows you to check to see if a newer version of WindowSMART 2015 is available. If a newer version is available, informational and download links will be provided, along with the version number and the date the latest version was released.</p>
<p class="SubTitle">Emergency Backup Tab</p>
<p class="BodyText">The Emergency Backup tab allows you to configure whether or not WindowSMART 2015 should attempt to back up the data on a disk that indicates it is about to fail. If you are running the Home edition, you can back up to a local disk. If you are running the Professional edition (including trial mode), you can back up to a local disk or remote computer (shared drive), and you also have the option of running a third-party backup tool.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Because some disks can signal failure on the Temperature and/or Airflow Temperature attributes if the disk gets too hot, and then &quot;un-fail&quot; when the disk cools off, WindowSMART has an option to skip backing up if the disk's only failure flag is that from a temperature-related attribute.</p>
<p class="BodyText">For backup to work correctly, you must specify a backup target location, whether a local disk/folder or a remote file share, and at least one source folder. You can back up entire disks, or just specific folders. If you back up to a remote share, WindowSMART automatically creates a folder that is the same name as the computer from which the backup is run. Since it is theoretically possible multiple comptuers could back up to the same location, this reduces the likelihood of one computer's backup overwriting another. If you back up to a remote share, you must also specify a username and password. If the target computer is a member of a workgroup, the username is specified as COMPUTERNAME\USERNAME; if the target computer is a member of a domain, the username is specified as DOMAIN\USERNAME. Regardless of domain or workgroup, the chosen account must have appropriate share permissions in order to write to the target. WindowSMART provides a &quot;Test&quot; button that allows you to validate the credentials. <strong>CAUTION</strong>: If password expiration is enforced by your administrator, you must update the password in WindowSMART if you change it. Otherwise the backup will fail.</p>
<p class="BodyText">If a disk failure is detected, WindowSMART will first attempt to correlate the failing disk(s) to the drive letter(s) residing on the disk(s). If the drive letter(s) match up to any entries in the list of disks/folders to back up, those items will be backed up. If none of the items on the list match up, no items will be backed up. If WindowSMART cannot determine the drive letter(s), all items on the list will be backed up. <strong>NOTE:</strong> If the backup target is a local disk, and the disk signalig failure is the intended backup disk, no backup is run.</p>
<p class="BodyText">If you don't want to use WindowSMART's built-in backup capability, or if you want to run a second backup to be safe, you can optionally specify a third-party backup program, along with arguments to pass to that backup program. If you want to pass a list of failing disk(s) to the backup program (by disk number), specify {PHYSICALDISKS} as part of the arguments. To pass a list of drive letters, specify {DRIVELETTERS}.</p>
<p class="SubTitle">Resources</p>
<p class="BodyText">The Resources section of the Settings dialogue provides you with buttons which display the About WindowSMART 2015 dialogue and the Bug Report Helper. The Bug Report Helper helps you should you wish to tender a bug report. URLs to various resources, including Dojo North Software and information about SMART are also provided.</p>
