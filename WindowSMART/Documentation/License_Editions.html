<p class="PageTitle">License Editions</p>
<p class="BodyText">WindowSMART 2015 is licensed, not sold. If you wish to continue using the software after the 30-day trial period, you must purchase a license. WindowSMART 2015 is available in Home and Professional editions. When in trial mode, WindowSMART functions as the Professional edition. Both license classes are detailed below.</p>
<p class="BodyText">Licenses are good forever, and require no renewal. Purchase a license one time, and all updates are free. This covers both minor updates and major upgrades.</p>
<p class="SubTitle">License Classes</p>
<p class="BodyText">WindowSMART 2015 is designed for businesses, but is simple enough for the home. WindowSMART 2015 is available in three versions, Single PC, Home and Professional.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><strong>Home</strong> licenses are designed for simplicity, and are licensed <em>per residential address</em>. This means you need to purchase only one license, and all of the computers in your home are covered. There's no need to count PCs to see how many licenses you need. One license, and your home is covered. It's that simple. Home licenses also cost less than Professional licenses. There is, however, a loss of some functionality in the Home edition. If you purchase multiple home licenses, you will be issued multiple keys. This allows you to purchase licenses to give to family and friends.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><strong>Single PC</strong> licenses are, like Home licenses, intended for use in a <em>home </em>environment. The only restriction is that you are allowed to install the software on <strong>ONE</strong> Windows PC. The advantage of the Single PC license is that it costs less than the Home license, and is intended primarily for homes where there is only one PC.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><strong>Professional</strong> licenses are intended for businesses. Professional licenses are licensed <em>per device</em>. This means if you want to install the software on 237 computers, you must purchase 237 licenses. Volume discounts are available in tiered quantities. If you require more than 1000 Professional licenses for a large business, please email msawyer91@dojonorthsoftware.net to request a custom quote. If you plan to use WindowSMART in a place of business (other than a home office), you must purchase a Professional license.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><span class="UnorderedListHeader">US Military Discount:</span> All active, reserve, honorably discharged and retired members of the United States military (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard and National Guard) are eligible for a discount of $5 off either of the Home license or 20% off a Professional license. If a service member is purchasing licenses for his/her business, the service member must be listed as the owner, co-owner or full partner in the company. Enlisted service members discharged dishonorably (DD) or for bad conduct (BCD) and officers dismissed due to a general court martial are not eligible.
