<p class="PageTitle">What's New in  WindowSMART 2015</p>
<p class="BodyText">WindowSMART 2015 is a new application from Dojo North Software, based on and inspired by the popularity of our add-in for Windows Home Server, Home Server SMART. The first version of Home Server SMART (HSS) was released for Windows Home Server v1, with a second version, Home Server SMART 2012, released for Windows Home Server 2011.
<p class="BodyText">WindowSMART is a desktop application, intended primarily to be run on client versions of Windows, including Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8. It can also be run on Server versions of Windows, including 2003, 2008, 2008 R2 and 2012.
<p class="BodyText">WindowSMART uses standard Windows APIs and Windows Management Instrumentation to collect information from disks. Thus WindowSMART should be able to successfully collect, analyze and report disk health data from a wide variety of controllers in desktops and laptops.
<p class="BodyText">New in version 3.0 of WindowSMART are thermal shutdown and emergency backup. If a disk is running too hot for an extended period of time, WindowSMART can shut down the computer. If a disk failure  condition is detected, WindowSMART can attempt to back up the data off the failing disk and, optionally, run a third-party backup program. Also new to WindowSMART v3.0 is a daily email summary of events and support for Windows 8/Server 2012 Storage Spaces.
<p class="BodyText">One item to bear in mind is that WindowSMART does NOT support retrieving SMART data from disks that are connected to hardware RAID controllers, particularly if the disks are participating in a hardware RAID array. If the disks are configured in a &quot;standalone&quot; configuration then WindowSMART may be able to get information from them. Since hardware RAID uses specialized drivers, they use proprietary APIs which this version of WindowSMART does not support.
<p class="BodyText">WindowSMART includes built-in SmartInspect logging capability. You can enable this functionality for troubleshooting purposes as well as reporting bugs.
